# SudokuSolver

This project solves any valid sudoku puzzle using a brute force approach.
My motivation to create this program began as a high school capstone project
to explain a sudoku puzzle as a graph theory coloring problem.  I then thought about 
how cool it would be if I wrote a program that could solve any sudoku puzzle
using the brute force algorithm I studied in class.  The summer after completing the capstone project, 
I first had to teach myself java to be able to write this program,
then I began building this project from scratch.

## Running the program

First, download the .java files.  Compile Sudoku.java which will also compile
the dependent files.  Run Sudoku from the console using the following usage:

java Sudoku \<infile\> [\<outfile\>] [--debug]
